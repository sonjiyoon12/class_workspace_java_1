The food is like paintings from many years ago. One painting becomes a falafel burger. Another becomes fish with green sauce. One salad has eggs and red vegetables. It looks like a painting, too.

There is also a cake. It has three colors: brown, white, and pink. It looks like an old painting of a cake. The cake has sweet frosting.

The magazine wants to show that food can be like art. The paintings are from a long time ago. The magazine starts in 1956, only a few years before the paintings.

Difficult words: art (paintings, sculptures, music, and so on), falafel (small round balls from herbs and beans), frosting (sweet cream on top of a cake).

You can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.
